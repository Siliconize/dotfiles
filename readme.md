Some scripts where written with chatgpt

Following packages need to be installed for everything to work:
```
sudo pacman -S i3-wm nitrogen picom cbatticon conky nm-applet volumeicon udiskie blueman setxkbmap xfce4-notifyd scrot rofi brightnessctl pactl mpc thunar kitty

```

might have missed some though.
